# Purpose of Flatcoin and How to Use
The purpose of Flatcoin is to allow users to view top trending cryptocoins and or view the top 20 cryptocurrencies on the market. Because this page is connected to the API coingecko, it stays up to date with the latest cryptocurrency data. You can test this by simply refreshing the page, and checking the changes in a number of different ways such as the price and or the 24h change. The page is separated by two features, which can be explained below:

</br>

### Slider
 The slider at the top of the page will automatically scroll to the left with the current top trending cryptocoins. There's a button beneath the slider with the current top trending coins that will allow the user to create and append a new cryptocoin to the slider. To add a new coin to the slider, click the add token button and a popup will appear. In the form, create a name and symbol for the coin, then input the url for an image source of your choosing for the image form. You will then see the coin you created appear on the slider.

### Top 20 Cryptocoins
The top 20 cryptocurrencies section of the page has a few different features. On the right, there is a form that will allow you to type the name of a coin you are searching for by primarily typing the name of a coin. The page will then render a result based on what was input.Initally, the page will render the 20 cryptocoins in a ranked order starting with price. By clicking on "#", "Price", "24h Change", "24h Volume", or "Market Cap", the page will swap the order of the clicked title with the first displayed result with the last result of that particular list.
